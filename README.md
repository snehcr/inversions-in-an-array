# inversions in an array
 Inversion Count for an array indicates â€“ how far (or close) the array is from being sorted. If the array is already sorted then the inversion count is 0. If the array is sorted in the reverse order that inversion count is the maximum. 
Two elements a[i] and a[j] form an inversion if a[i] > a[j] and i < j. For simplicity, we may assume that all elements are unique.
